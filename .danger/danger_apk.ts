**Great news! Your PR builds âœ…**

We've managed to generate a R8-optimized 
_(minify, obfuscate, and shrink resources)_ APK with your changes. ðŸ‘Œ

It's way faster than the \`debug\` build type but sometimes it may crash. 
So please, **test** and enjoy your lightning-fast **[Ivy-Wallet-Demo.apk](${artifactURL})**. âš¡

_**Note:** It's important to download and test this APK artifact from the **["APK" workflow](${artifactURL})** 
or the link above because it may introduce runtime crashes in production._`
