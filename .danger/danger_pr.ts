## Congratulations! 🎉 You're almost there...

Your PR is a fact and it'll be reviewed as soon as possible. The last step is to receive an approving review and merge it. ✅

**The final thing left to do is:**
- Upload a screen recording to prove that your code works. _(without it we can't merge your PR)_

**Code quality tips:**
- The keyword is **simplicity**.
- Can I do it in a more simple and straightforward way?
- Can I do it with less code? If so, delete what's unnecessary.
- Did I over-engineer it?

_Thank you for your contribution! 👏_`
