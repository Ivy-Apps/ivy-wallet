# Parser

A functional recursive descent parser used for implementing
Ivy Wallet's calculator expressions and formulas.

It's motivated by and
implements [FUNCTIONAL PEARLS Monadic Parsing in Haskell](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pearl.pdf)
in Kotlin.

The purpose of this module is to allow its users to parse any arbitrary text in a concise manner.
