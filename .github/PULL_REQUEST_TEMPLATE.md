### Detekt
[Detekt](https://detekt.dev/) is a static code analyzer for Kotlin that we use to enforce code readibility and good practices.

**To run Detekt locally:**
```
./gradlew detekt
```

If the Detekt errors are caused by a legacy code, you can suppress them using a basline.

**Detekt baseline** (not recommended)
```
./scripts/detektBaseline.sh
```

### Lint

We use the [standard Android Lint](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/lint) plus [Slack's compose-lints](https://slackhq.github.io/compose-lints/) as an addition to enforce proper Compose usage.

**To run Lint locally:**
```
./scripts/lint.sh
```

If the Lint errors are caused by a legacy code, you can suppress them using a basline.

**Lint baseline** (not recommended)
```
./scripts/lintBaseline.sh
```

### Unit tests

If this job is failing this means that your changes break an existing unit test. You must identify the failing tests and fix your code.

**To run the Unit tests locally:**
```
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```
