Ivy Wallet is a **free money manager android app** written using 100% Jetpack Compose and Kotlin. It's designed to help you track your personal finance with ease.

Imagine Ivy Wallet as a manual expense tracker that will replace the good old spreadsheet for managing your personal finance.

Track your expenses, fast and on-the-go! ‚ö° Discover powerful insights about your spending.

**Do you know? Ask yourself.**

1) How much money do I have right now in all accounts combined?

2) How much did I spend this month and where?

3) How much money can I spend and still reach my financial goals?

A money manager app can help you answer these questions.

Ivy Wallet's biggest advantage is its UI/UX, simplicity, and customization which was recognized in the ["Top/Best Android App in 2021/2022 charts"](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLguJN0waG1-eSzKMuFMIULrR3MlqJ3cAE) 10+ times by the YouTube tech community.

## Architecture
We strive to keep our architecture "perfect" by putting software-design and code quality first. 

We read a lot of books, CS papers, blogs and follow latest research in the industry.

Our goal is to make this repo **the go-to project to learn about Android Development latest best
practices** and **software architecture.**

### High-level view:

- [Modular architecture](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/09/announcing-new-guide-to-android-app-modularization.html)
- [FRP (Functional Reactive Programming)](https://www.toptal.com/android/functional-reactive-programming-part-1)
- [MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Model-View-ViewModel#:~:text=Model%2DView%2DViewModel%20(MVVM)%20is%20a%20software%20design,Ken%20Cooper%20and%20John%20Gossman.)

We've documented every major architecture decision as **ADR (Architecture Decision Record)**
in **[docs/architecture](docs/architecture/)**. The best thing about ADRs is that you can see not
only what went well but also what didn't!

If you're starting out with the Ivy Wallet project first have a look at our **[:core](core/)**
module.

We're also linking **great learning materials (books, videos, articles, papers)**
in **[docs/resources üìö](docs/resources/)**.
