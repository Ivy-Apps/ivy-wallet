# [Ivy Wallet: money manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ivy.wallet)

## Ideology :earth_africa:

We believe that people _(not corporations or business entities)_ can create innovative, open-source,
and free software that can make the world a better place.

**We want Ivy to be:**

- A place where you can excel and have fun while contributing to something meaningful.
- A community where you can express yourself freely and build the future that you want to live in.
- An open-source project that'll inspire a movement where people can build the software they want
  and eventually become a DAO where hundreds of developers can work on their own terms.

**We believe in:**

- Freedom.
- Creativity & Innovation.
- Challenging the status quo.
- Decentralization.
- Having the right to do what you believe in, not what you're told to.

Ivy Wallet is a free budget manager and spending tracker app that’ll help you manage your personal finances with ease.

Imagine Ivy Wallet as a digital financial notebook (manual expense tracker) in which you’ll track your income, expenses, and budget.

The advantage that our money manager gives you is that you can track expenses on the go with an intuitive and simple user interface (UI).

Once your transactions make their way into Ivy Wallet, the spending tracker app will give you insight into your monthly spending and help you plan your budgets.

When you enter more income and expenses in the money manager app you'll have an answer to three essential questions:

1) Exactly how much money do I have right now in all accounts combined? (money manager)

2) How much did I spend this month and where? (expense tracker)

3) How much money can I spend and still reach my financial goals? (budget manager)

$Track. $Budget. $Save
