3. Comment `"I'm on it"` on the ticket to let other contributors know that you're working on it.

### Tips:

- Issues with the
  label [good first issue](https://github.com/Ivy-Apps/ivy-wallet/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
  are easier.

  by identifying duplicate issues.
- You can always make code improvements w/o having an opened issue.
- You create an issue yourself!
- Ask questions or suggest ideas in the comments section of any issue.

## 3. Create a feature branch in your fork

Once you've decided on what you want to contribute it's time to create a feature branch in your
forked ivy-wallet
repository.

### Console:

`cd forked-ivy-wallet-repo-dir`

`git checkout -b fix-issue-N`

- Make commits.
- Refactor your code.
- Verify that your implementation works.
- Test that you haven't broken existing features.

### Tips:

- Make sure that you didn't break anything with your changes.
- Keep it simple.
- **"Don't walk away from complexity, run!"**

## 4. Submit a PR to `main` branch

So far you should have pushed your work to your feature branch and have tested
that it works on an actual Android device.
Then final step is to open a pull request to the `main` branch of the
official [Ivy Wallet repo.](https://github.com/Ivy-Apps/ivy-wallet/pulls)

**[How To Submit a PR Guide by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)**

### IMPORTANT:

- Make sure that on the base repository's base the `main` branch is chosen as "base".
- Pull requests to other branches will be rejected.
