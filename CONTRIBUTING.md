# Contributing to Ivy Wallet

## 1. Fork the repo

You can do that by cliking this badge: ðŸ‘‰ [![Fork Ivy Wallet](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/Ivy-Apps/ivy-wallet?logo=github&style=social)](https://github.com/Ivy-Apps/ivy-wallet/fork) ðŸ‘ˆ

**[How To Fork Guide by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)**

## 2. Pick an issue

What do you want to work on? How do you want to contribute?

### Workflow:

1. Browse **[Ivy Wallet Issues](https://github.com/Ivy-Apps/ivy-wallet/issues)**.
2. Choose a ticket that you understand and intrigues you.
3. Comment `"I'm on it"` on the ticket to let other contributors know that you're working on it.

### Rules:

- Issues with a green `"approved"` label are ready for development.
- If the issue that you like doesn't have `"approved"` label, just **tag @ILIYANGERMANOV**.
- If someone else has already commented **"I'm on it"**, do **not** start working on it! Instead tag the person and ask if you can take it.
- If what you want to do isn't in issues, just **create it** and **tag @ILIYANGERMANOV**.

## 3. Create a feature branch in your fork

Once you've decided on what you want to work, it's time to create a feature branch in your forked ivy-wallet repository.

### Console:

`cd ivy-wallet-fork`

`git checkout -b fix-issue-N`

- Make commits.
- Refactor your code.
- Verify that your implementation works.
- Test that you haven't broken existing features.

### Tips:

- Make sure that you didn't break anything with your changes.
- Keep it simple.
- **"Don't walk away from complexity, run!"**

## 4. Submit a PR to `main` branch

So far, you should have pushed your work to your feature branch and have tested
that it works on a real Android device.
Then final step is to open a pull request to the `main` branch of the
official [Ivy Wallet repo.](https://github.com/Ivy-Apps/ivy-wallet/pulls)

**[How To Submit a PR Guide by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)**

### IMPORTANT:

- Make sure that on the base repository's base the `main` branch is chosen as "base".
- Pull requests to other branches will be rejected.
- Ivy Wallet doesn't have QA so **you are the QA!** Please test your implementation carefully.
