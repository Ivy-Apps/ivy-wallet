# Paid Tasks

Paid tasks are GitHub issues with the label `paid`. They are created by and must be approved by `@founders` team.

The idea of `paid` tasks is to delegate work, reward contributors, and **make founders life easier.** (save `@core-devs` team time!)

## Motivation

_(Aug 23, 2022)_ Ivy Wallet is an enormous product for just 2 developers (Iliyan, Vishwa) and 1 designer (Stefan).
