# Troubleshooting CI failures

If you see any of the PR checks failing (‚ùå) go to [Actions](https://github.com/Ivy-Apps/ivy-wallet/actions) and find it there. Or simply click "Details" next to the failed check and explore the logs to see why it has failed.

## Detekt
[Detekt](https://detekt.dev/) is a static code analyzer for Kotlin that we use to enforce code readibility and good practices.

**To run Detekt locally:**
```
./gradlew detekt
```

If the Detekt errors are caused by a legacy code, you can suppress them using a basline.

**Suppress Detekt** (only if you're sure that Detekt is wrong)

Add `@Suppress("ID_OF_THE_CHECK")` to ignore the error on a single place. For example:
```kotlin
@Suppress("FunctionMaxLength")
fun veryVeryLongFunction() {
    // ...
}
```

**Detekt baseline** (not recommended)
```
./scripts/detektBaseline.sh
```

## Lint

We use the [standard Android Lint](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/lint) plus [Slack's compose-lints](https://slackhq.github.io/compose-lints/) as an addition to enforce proper Compose usage.

**To run Lint locally:**
```
./scripts/lint.sh
```

If the Lint errors are caused by a legacy code, you can suppress them using a basline.

**Suppress Lint** (only if you're sure that Lint is wrong)

Same as suppressing Detekt, just add `@Suppress("ID_OF_CHECK")`.

**Lint baseline** (not recommended)
```
./scripts/lintBaseline.sh
```

## Unit tests

If this job is failing this means that your changes break an existing unit test. You must identify the failing tests and fix your code.

**To run the Unit tests locally:**
```
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```

## Compose Stability

This GitHub Action checks whether your `@Composable` functions are stable (i.e. "restartable" and "skippable"). If it fails it means that some of your composables are unstable. That causes unnecessary recompositions which can lead to lost frames and laggy UI/UX especially when animation or scrolling. You must fix that! To fix it, open the failing working and see the output from report - it tells you which `@Composable` functions are unstable and what parameters cause that.

**Compose Stability baseline** (not recommended)
```
./scripts/composeStabilityBaseline.sh
```
Do that only if the failure is in legacy code. If the script is failing, open it and execute the commands inside it manually.
