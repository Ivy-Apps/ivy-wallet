## 50% of our profit goes to contributors

We'll share 50% of our pure profit with contributors in the form of **"Contributors" fund**.

> profit = revenue - taxes - fees - operational costs

_Example: $10,000 revenue is ~$6k in profit. (15-20% GooglePlay fee, ~20% Bulgarian taxes, operational costs)_

The money from the Contributors fund will be assigned as a bounty for `paid` tasks. Each `paid` task is labeled with "paid" and will have `bounty`, details & success criteria.

Contributors can show interest in the comments of a `paid` tasks and `@founders` will approve and assign the task to a contributor.

Each task will have milestones and deadline. If the task is solved successfully and passes success criteria the `bounty` will be paid to the contributor who solved it.

Tasks bounty while we are poor, will range between $10-$100. 

## We're looking for a win-win!
