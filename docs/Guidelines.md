# 🏗️ Developer Guidelines

The biggest challenge in software engineering is the fight against **complexity**. If you're planning to contribute to Ivy Wallet, we mainly care about two things:

1. Your PR works and doesn't break anything.
2. Your PR is simple and doesn't add complexity.

Software engineering is also about **thinking**. Don't just blindly follow best practices and strive to do the "right" thing. Instead, ask yourself:

- Is this the simplest solution?
- Am I over-engineering? What does this give me?
- Can we make it simpler?

Be **pragmatic**. Engineering is all about being practical and finding optimal trade-offs. Our world isn't ideal so there isn't a "perfect" solution. The best we can do is optimize for things we care about.

> Follow [the 80/20 principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) - from 20% effort comes 80% of the results.

In Ivy Wallet we care about:

- Software complexity
- Stability
- Simplicity


To recap - **THINK** and keep it simple.
